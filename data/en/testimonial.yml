I’m turning age fifty in 52 days. When I was young, I often used the phrase “an aging grey-haired fifty-year-old” a lot in my essay writing. That phrase sounds so
horrible and wrong, doesn’t it? However, right now, I feel like I’m just about to enter my prime. Age is a gift from life. Slowly and gradually, I’ve managed to pick up the
art of living, with a mind that’s spiritually rich and free.


***“A wonderful life is all about making choices by freewill and fulfilling one’s responsibilities in the right manner.”
 - Luis de León***


At the current stage of my life, all I feel is blessed. In the first twenty years of my life, I was able to do what I had loved under the wings of my parents. Then for the
past thirty years, I’ve managed to deal with my part of duty responsibly with the assistance and support from my friends.


As I’m turning fifty, I plan to be self-indulgent and give myself a gift: DooCoco, a brand associated with wonderful life experiences. It also happens to be what I’m
truly passionate about. The reason I named this brand DooCoco is that I love the way these alphabets sit together and the rhythm when you read them out loud.


I want to explore and create artworks that can accompany all of us timelessly as gifts, alongside with outstanding designers and craftsmen together. These
artworks will last in time. We get to touch and appreciate the beauty and charm within them in our everyday life. May the beauty and charm help make our lives
delightful, even though sometimes we inevitably run into things that are not so great in lives.


Five cashmere scarves are introduced as launch products of DooCoco F/W20 “EMBRACE 拥抱” series, merely for the unique character of cashmere, that offers
the most sense of companion among all textiles. Cashmere works just like love, warm but not restraining. In the year of 2020, during the exhausting pandemic, and
all the other challenges we are facing, we need more care and love than ever.


Let us embrace ourselves, embrace those who we treasure the most in our lives, and embrace tomorrow.
